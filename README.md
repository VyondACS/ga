# ZimmerTwins Revival
because the zimmertwins website got shut down back in august 2020 (one month before i joined youtube) i desided to do a recreation of the project using node.js. please note that right now, this project is currently unstable and is currently not ready for use yet. there will be updates if it's ready for not. it is just as easy to use as the LVM with your dialoge box, moving stuff around, and eta.
